## Summary

The basic idea is to marry a small [led projector](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=led+projector) with a [FireFox phone](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/devices/) and some modified whiteboard pens with [IR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) [LED diodes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode) for tips to create a hardware platform that combines the concepts invented by [Johnny Lee](http://johnnylee.net/) and demonstrated in his TED talk [Johnny Lee demos wii remote hacks](http://www.ted.com/talks/johnny_lee_demos_wii_remote_hacks?language=en) with cheap mobile and projection hardware and a flexible and siple [mobile os](//github.com/jan-os/janos) to create a platform to deliver telepresence for the purpose of learning.
