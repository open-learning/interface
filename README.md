# Open Learning Interface

Interface is a hardware platform to allow anyone to facillitate [`open-learning` collaborate](http://open-learning.org/collaborate/) sessions anywhere.

## Summary

The basic idea is to marry a small [led projector](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=led+projector) with a [FireFox phone](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/devices/) and some modified whiteboard pens to create hardware that can provide learning anywhere in the world where you can find internet, a place to gather and students who want to learn.

For the OS we're thinking to base it on [janos](https://github.com/jan-os/janos) - An OS for IoT devices.
